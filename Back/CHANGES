1.09  . set -f default to 0
      . help message improved

1.08  . remove singletons before sorting for speed-up. This feature can
        be influenced by using the -f (for fast) option: larger value
        for -f is faster (but possibly less accurate); a value of 0
        is equivalent to previous version of text_cat.

1.07: . moved `my' declaration from for-loop in order that script works
        for older versions of Perl.

1.06: . -l option if you want to pass on text on the command line:
        text_cat -l "this is English text"

1.05: . tiny improvements in the code, based on reading the Perl
        Cookbook.

1.04: . -a option to determine the value of the feature introduced in
        1.01 (if you don't like 10).
      . reads directory before input is read (useful if something is wrong)
      . warning if no language models in directory (before input is read)
      . comments in .lm files are gone. This was only useful for my
        couse last year anyway :-)

1.03: added $! to error messages

1.02: rumantsch

1.01: system reports unknown language if more than 10 candidate solutions.
      why 10? Why not? Who knows?
