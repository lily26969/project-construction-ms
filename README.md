## 🌍 Project Context

Construction is a high-stakes industry where poor coordination and siloed systems can lead to:

- Delays and budget overruns
- Communication breakdowns
- Untraceable documents
- Risky manual tracking

Digital transformation is no longer optional—it’s necessary. MRAMMA brings this vision to life with a smart, affordable, and fully integrated web platform.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Despite the availability of tools like **Procore**, **PlanGrid**, and **Buildertrend**, most are:

- Overpriced for small/mid-size enterprises
- Complex to adopt
- Weak in budget tracking, collaboration, or HR modules

🧨 **Pain Points Identified**:

- Poor financial visibility  
- Communication gaps & delays  
- Limited integration across tools  
- Lack of contextual task alerts and smart notifications

---

## 🚀 Proposed Solution

MRAMMA delivers an all-in-one cloud-ready construction platform with:

- 📦 **Modular Architecture** – each feature is a plug-and-play microservice
- 🔐 **Enterprise-grade security** using **Keycloak**
- 📊 **Real-time dashboards** for finances, tasks, and KPIs
- 🛍️ **Built-in online marketplace** for tools and rental equipment
- 🧠 **Smart budgeting, tracking, and forecasting**

## 🔐 Keycloak Authentication

We use **Keycloak** for secure authentication and authorization. It supports:

- User registration and login
- Role-based access control
- Token-based session management
- Integration with Angular and Spring Boot

### 🔧 Realms & Clients

| Realm Name           | Purpose                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `constructionRealm`  | Main authentication realm for MRAMMA |
| `admin-console`      | Default admin realm              |

| Client ID            | Use Case                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `frontapp`    | Angular frontend (public client) |
| `backapp`     | Spring Boot backend (confidential client) |

### ▶️ How to Run Keycloak Locally

1. **Download and extract Keycloak (v23.0.6)**  
   [https://www.keycloak.org/downloads](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/3ivnej0a1kwfq/keycloak-23.04666666)

2. **Start Keycloak in development mode**  
   ```bash
   cd keycloak-23.0.6/bin
   ./kc.sh start-dev
   ```
      ```cmd
   cd keycloak-23.0.6/bin
   kc.bat start-dev
   ```

3. **Login to Admin Console**  
   http://localhost:8080  
   (Default: `admin / admin` unless changed)

4. **Import Realm & Clients (Optional)**  
   Use the exported `constructionRealm-realm.json` (available in `/realms/`)  
   > Settings → Import → Select JSON

5. **Frontend & Backend Configuration**
   - Frontend uses `keycloak-js` to connect to the `frontapp` public client.
   - Backend uses `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server` with the `backapp` confidential client via the keycloak config file .

## 🧩 System Architecture

### 🔌 Logical Architecture

- **Frontend (Angular)** handles UI/UX, routing, form validation, and user interactions.
- **Backend (Spring Boot)** serves RESTful endpoints for all modules: Auth, Claims, Projects, Tasks, HR, Finance, and Shop.
- **Keycloak** manages identity, access control, and session security.
- **MySQL** is the shared relational DB across all services (scalable per module).

### 🌐 Physical Architecture

- Microservices are containerized and exposed through a common gateway (planned).
- Modular services can scale independently.
